# Developing The Dev Day Website

The Dev Day website is built using [Django CMS](https://www.django-cms.org/).
The project consists of a Django CMS content management part and some custom Django apps for talk, attendee and speaker management.

## Documentation

This project uses a number of tools and frameworks. Here are the major
documentation links:

- Django: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/
- Django-CMS: http://docs.django-cms.org/en/release-3.8.x/
- Crispy-Forms: https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- Python 3: https://docs.python.org/3/
- yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs
- Sass: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html
- Gulp: https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/v3.9.1/docs
- Docker/Docker-Compose: https://docs.docker.com/

## Getting Started: Running for the first time

```
# ./run.sh devdata
```

This will create the required Docker containers, start the application and create some test data.

After running this command you can go to http://localhost:8000 to browse the website or to http://localhost:8000/admin/ to get to the administration interface.

You can use the following credentials to log in as administrator:

```
user: admin@devday.de
password: admin
``` 

## Running the development environment

You can run a local development environment easily with Docker and Docker Compose.  Make sure you have current versions of both installed.

You can use [run.sh](./run.sh) to build, start and stop the Docker containers,
import a database dump, and purge all local data.

These commands are supported:

### `backup`: Create a backup

This creates a backup of the database and the media files. It creates a `db-`_timestamp_`.sql.gz` file with the database contents, and a `media-`_timestamp_`.tar.gz` file with the contents of the `devday/media` directory. Both are created in the backup directory; the _timestamp_ is the current date and time.

```
$ ./run.sh backup
*** Running backup
Starting devday_hp_db_1 ... done
+ cd /app/backup
++ date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S%z
+ BACKUPDATE=20180913-141636+0000
+ pg_dump -U devday -h db -p 5432 devday
+ gzip
+ tar czf media-20180913-141636+0000.tar.gz -C /app/media .
```

### `build`: Build the necessary Docker images

This should only be necessary if Postgres, Django or other service and framework versions change.

```
$ ./run.sh build
Building db
Step 1/5 : FROM postgres
 ---> 978b82dc00dc

...

Step 5/5 : COPY httpd.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/

```

### `buildbase`: Build the Python base Docker image

This builds the base Docker image including dependencies from Pipfile.lock and
should be used when you make changes to the Python dependencies or want to use
a recent Debian Buster base image. This image is published to
[Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/devdaydresden/devday_website_python_base).

```
./run.sh buildbase

### `compose`: Run `docker-compose`

This invokes Docker Compose with the compose files appropriate for the development setup.

### `coverage`: Run Coverage Report

Using [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/), generate a report of test code coverage. The report will be printed, and a HTML version will be generated in devday/coverage-report.  `coverage` will run `manage.py test` to check test code coverage.

### `coveralls`: Submit `coverage` report to coveralls.io

Submit the `coverage` results to [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/github/devdaydresden/devday_website).  If you're running this outside of Travis CI, you need to supply the necessary environment variables. See [Supported CI Services](https://docs.coveralls.io/supported-ci-services).

### `devdata`: Create database contents suitable for development

This will fill an empty database with pages, events, and attendees.

It also creates an admin user `admin@devday.de` with password `admin`.

```
$ ./run.sh devdata
    Starting containers
Creating network "devday_hp_default" with the default driver
Creating volume "devday_hp_devday_media" with default driver
Creating volume "devday_hp_devday_static" with default driver
...
```

### `docker-push`: Push out custom images to Docker Hub

Make sure you're logged in to Docker Hub with a user that is allowed to push to the `devdaydresden` organization.  For Travis etc., set DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD to have run.sh log in before pushing.

### `logs`: Show Logs of the App Container

Tail the logs from the app container, which is running `manage.py runserver`.

```
$ ./run.sh log
Attaching to devday_hp_app_1
app_1    | Performing system checks...
app_1    |
app_1    | System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

app_1    | Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
app_1    | Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

### `manage`: Run Django Admin

For development and maintenance tasks, run the Django Admin command inside the app container. This simply runs `python3 manage.py $@`.

```
$ ./run.sh manage migrate
```

### `messages`: Update transation message catalogs

This will run `makemessages` and `compilemessages` with the appropriate options.

### `restore`: Start the development environment and import a database dump.

Any preexisting volumes will be deleted first
```
$ ./run.sh -d backup/db-20180904-133216.sql.gz -m backup/media-20180904-133216.tar.gz restore

```

### `shell`: Run a shell in the app container
This command starts an interactive shell inside the app container, which contains the Python environment.

```
$ ./run.sh shell

### `test`: Run Python Tests

This command runs `manage.py test` inside the app container.

## Developer Tips

### Reading emails

During development Django will use the `django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend`, which will send emails to 
stdout (console) of the Docker container running the app.

That means that you can easily read the emails by checking the log of the Docker container running the app:

```shell script
# ./run.sh logs
```


## Structure of the project

The Django app can be found in [devday/](./devday). The [docker/](./docker) directory contains the necessary Dockerfiles to create the images; a set of `docker-compose-*.yml` files provide the Docker Compose configuration. The [frontend/](./frontend) directory contains the Web frontend workspace, including it's own Docker tooling, see [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) for details.

## URL Structure of the Dev Day Website

The site has been restructured to allow multiple events to be served concurrently.  Most URLs have been updated, and many of the existing views have been refactored.

### Public Information

* **/** Redirect to current event (as determined by devday/devday/settings/base.py EVENT_ID)
* **/`event`/** Homepage, managed by DjangoCMS
* **/`event`/talk/** List of accepted talks for this event.  Once all accepted talks have been assigned a slot, this will show the session grid.
* **/`event`/talk/*slug*/`ID`** Detail page for an accepted talk, including speaker bio.

### Attendee And Speaker Management

Attendees, including speakers, can review and update their personal information.  People submitting a proposed talk will complete their attendee registration as part of the speaker registration, if they have not registered yet.

* **/account** Attendee account information.

### Speaker And Talk Information

* **/account/speaker** Speaker information; all registered users can input data here, but this is only required if the user wants to submit a talk proposal. The page also lists all talk proposals the user has made, and includes a link to submitting a new talk.  Talks are filtered by the current event (no past talks are shown).

### Committee Members

* **/committee/talks** Overview of all submitted talks, including links to speakers, talks.  The talks pages have the voting and comment functions.
(defined in `devday/talk/url-committee.py`)

### Special URLS

* **/schedule.xml** InfoBeamer data URL.
